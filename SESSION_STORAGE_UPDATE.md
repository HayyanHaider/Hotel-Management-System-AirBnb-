# ✅ Session Storage Implementation

## What Changed

All authentication storage has been updated from `localStorage` to `sessionStorage`.

## Updated Files

1. ✅ `frontend/src/components/Login.jsx`
2. ✅ `frontend/src/components/Signup.jsx`
3. ✅ `frontend/src/components/Navbar.jsx`
4. ✅ `frontend/src/components/ProtectedRoute.jsx`
5. ✅ `frontend/src/components/CustomerDashboard.jsx`
6. ✅ `frontend/src/components/HotelOwnerDashboard.jsx`
7. ✅ `frontend/src/components/AdminDashboard.jsx`
8. ✅ `frontend/src/components/ReportsSection.jsx`

## Behavior

### Before (localStorage):
- User logs in → Stays logged in forever (even after closing browser)
- User must manually log out
- Data persists across browser sessions

### After (sessionStorage):
- User logs in → Stays logged in during browser session
- **Stays logged in on page refresh** ✅
- **Automatically logged out when browser tab/window is closed** ✅
- Data cleared when browser session ends

## How It Works

**sessionStorage:**
- Stores data for the duration of the page session
- Data persists through page refreshes
- Data is cleared when the tab/window is closed
- Each tab has its own sessionStorage

**Perfect for:**
- Temporary authentication
- Single-session data
- Security-conscious applications

## Testing

1. **Login and Refresh:**
   ```
   1. Login to the app
   2. Refresh the page (F5 or Ctrl+R)
   3. ✅ You should still be logged in
   ```

2. **Login and Close Tab:**
   ```
   1. Login to the app
   2. Close the browser tab/window
   3. Open a new tab and go to the app
   4. ✅ You should be logged out (redirected to login)
   ```

3. **Multiple Tabs:**
   ```
   1. Login in Tab 1
   2. Open Tab 2 with the same app
   3. ✅ Tab 2 will NOT be logged in (separate session)
   ```

## Code Changes

### Before:
```javascript
localStorage.setItem('token', token);
localStorage.getItem('token');
localStorage.removeItem('token');
```

### After:
```javascript
sessionStorage.setItem('token', token);
sessionStorage.getItem('token');
sessionStorage.removeItem('token');
```

## Benefits

✅ **Better Security** - Credentials don't persist indefinitely
✅ **Auto Logout** - Users are logged out when they close the browser
✅ **Page Refresh Safe** - Users stay logged in during active session
✅ **Privacy** - Data doesn't persist across sessions

## Note

If you want to go back to persistent login (localStorage), simply replace all instances of `sessionStorage` back to `localStorage` in the files listed above.
